## About The Project

A 'matching-cards' game to test your memory. A project started to learn **React** development. The game has 3 categories to select from _Pokemon_, _Rick and Morty_ and _Dogs_. The project was built using [Vite][vite]. In the start I was planning on making the project fully responsive and pretty but towards the end I got really bored of CSS styling so some of the features haven't been styled. All the features of the game work but may not be styled properly. Each of the category uses a free API: [PokeAPI][pokeapi], [Rick and Morty][rickmortapi],[Dogs Api][dogapi]

### Tools Used

### Features
